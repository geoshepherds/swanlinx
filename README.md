Swan-Linx is a health and fitness and lifestyle project that began in the 2013-2014
academic year, with the aims of investigating and collecting data on the health, fitness,
nutrition, and physical activity of schoolchildren in years 5 and 6 (9-11 years old). Swan-Linx
is a joint initiative owned and delivered in partnership between City and County of Swansea
and Swansea University, and is a continuation of the Sportslinx project undertaken in
Liverpool from 1996 to 2013, using the same principles and procedures. Sportslinx was
presented with the Louis Bonduelle award in 2011 for its excellence in nutrition and physical
activity research. The award also recognised how schools and children were continually
engaged in the project. Sportslinx highlighted the reduction in health-related fitness and
unsatisfactory dietary habits of Liverpool schoolchildren, and indicated that children were not
sufficiently active, contributing to increasing levels of overweight and obesity. The project
used these findings to drive policy and intervention changes in Liverpool.


By gathering data and providing accurate information about the health, fitness, physical
activity, and dietary habits of children in the local area, Swan-Linx works in collaboration
with the City and County of Swansea Active Young People (AYP) and Community Sports
Development Team to inform service and policy. It is encouraged that this report is shared
with the AYP officers in your area, who can provide children with the opportunity to
participate in a range of sport and physical activities, as well as provide links to the local
community to encourage children to continue participation after school.
With the Swan-Linx baseline data having been obtained in 2013-2014, and the continuation
of the project in the 2014-2015 academic year, and hopefully years succeeding, the growing
data archive will allow population level changes in the health, fitness, dietary habits, and
physical activity to be monitored yearly, as well as enable the effect of any interventions
implemented to be highlighted. Therefore, we would like to thank all of the schools for their
continued support throughout this year’s Swan-Linx project, and we hope that the schools
will continue to participate in the programme in the future.
